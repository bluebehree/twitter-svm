# Twitter SVM

This project was part of the third problem set of the Intro to Machine Learning class (CS M146) I took at UCLA. I ported the code to Python 3 and made some slight changes to clean up the program.

## Summary

## Procedure pt.1: Feature Extraction

## Procedure pt.2: Hyperparameter Selection for a Linear-Kernel SVM

## Procedure pt.3: Hyperparameter Selection for a RBF-Kernel SVM
